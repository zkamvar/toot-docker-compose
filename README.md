# Docker Compose toot

Date: 2020-03-25

## Motivation

I am trying to learn docker-compose because I *believe* that it *may* be able to
help us deploy a better system for building tutorials for the maintainers. The
current system works to a degree, but requires the maintainers to have similar
computational setups. This limits the nubmer of people who can contribute
lessons to those who are technically adept. We want to lower the barrier.

This toot is from <https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/>.
